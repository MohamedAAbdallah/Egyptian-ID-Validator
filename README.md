# Egyptian ID Validator

A language-agnostic, open-source initiative for validating Egyptian National ID numbers across multiple programming environments.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

This repository serves as the **central hub** for all platform-specific Egyptian ID validation libraries.  
Each implementation adheres to a shared validation specification, enabling developers to integrate robust ID parsing and verification into web, mobile, backend, and embedded systems.
